**@all** is a third-party GroupMe chat bot built on [Hubot][hubot]. It was configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

[heroku]: http://www.heroku.com
[hubot]: http://hubot.github.com

## Features

Mention (tag) everyone in your group at once!

Blacklist users who don't need notifications.

Deploy to heroku easily!

## Using

In practice, users can simply write `@all` anywhere in their message to tag everyone in the group. The bot will repeat their message and tag everyone in the group in their repeated message.

You can also control a blacklist/whitelist via chat commands as well. This is a bit more advanced, so please review the source code yourself if you're interested to do this.

### Deploying to Heroku

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
    - And please star it to show your support. It's free for you and helps me a lot :yellow_heart:
2. Log in to Heroku
3. Create a new app
4. Deploy from your GitHub and select the repo
5. Configure environment variables (and optionally Redis)

If you're deploying via Heroku, you're done! :tada: The rest of this document is more specific to non-heroku users. See the end of the document if you need help.

## Manual setup

### Configuration

Start by configuring the environment variables below:

- `HUBOT_GROUPME_TOKEN`
- `HUBOT_GROUPME_ROOM_ID`
- `HUBOT_GROUPME_BOT_ID`

And optionally configure a Redis server for blacklist persistence.


### Running

Once configured, you can compile the bot with `npm run build` and then run the bot with `npm run start`.

You should now be able to open the GroupMe room you've chosen and tag everyone in the group by mentioning **@all**!
